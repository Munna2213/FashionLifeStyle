<p>3D fashion design technology is changing the way designers in the fashion industry approach product development, pattern making, and fittings. On the one hand, 3D clothing design software simplifies the design development process, saving time and money while reducing environmental impact. While on the other hand, 3D and augmented reality experiences enable fashion brands to connect with audiences all over the world, resulting in stronger brand affinity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the advent of virtual clothing, fashion designers no longer need to use real fabrics or sew by hand. This has transformed the way clothing is made and manufactured.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-3d-fashion-design">What is 3D fashion design?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3D in fashion design is the process of developing a 3D prototype out of a 2D digital pattern. With the help of 3D technology, designers can now build a 3D garment directly on a digital avatar (model) of their size.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3D digital design helps brands design and sample clothing more quickly and with less waste.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>3D technology can display ultrarealistic images of a garment, including the fabric drape and appearance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead of working with 2D patterns and files, fashion designers are using 3D software to stitch patterns together and provide a production-ready 3D version of a garment.</p>

<h2 id="the-benefits-of-3d-fashion-design">The benefits of 3D fashion design</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Adidas, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, and even small fashion companies are incorporating 3D solutions into their design workflow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The benefits that 3D design tools can provide to apparel companies are substantial:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="it-speeds-up-your-production">It speeds up your production</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the most important advantages is that they help increase overall production speed. Designers can perform many virtual iterations of a garment, potentially shortening the product's time to market by weeks or months. If you make a mistake during the design process, you can easily edit your patterns. If you're making symmetrical garments, virtual design tools have a number of time-saving features that can sync together patterns for either the left and right sides or the front and back of the design.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 id="it-lowers-sample-making-costs">It lowers sample-making costs</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3D technology reduces sample-making costs significantly. Brands can create and share photorealistic garment visuals without making a physical sample.</p>

<h3 id="it-helps-reduce-waste">It helps reduce waste</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another benefit is that the 3D process addresses the sustainability issue by drastically reducing waste associated with many rounds of sample sewing. Working in 3D is simply the most ethical and sustainable way to design clothing. You can create your collection in 3D, hold virtual fittings in 3D, and even release it virtually.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To create a 3D garment, you will need to make a 3D avatar (model) first. The creator has complete control over the figure's parameters (height, waist, and chest circumference). For instance, avatars with pre-set parameters specific to this sport are employed while designing clothing for athletes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, you will start drafting the 2D pattern. Many 3D fashion design solutions also allow you to import digital patterns into their systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then the pattern pieces are sewn together and fitted onto the avatar. From there, you can add the fabric properties, stitch types, and adjust the fit of the garment with the help of stress maps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to assess how the clothing would behave in real life, the designer builds a product using the components and replicates the actions of the 3D model fashion avatar (dancing, sprinting up the catwalk, etc.). Unloading patterns for later transfer to production are a crucial element.</p>

<h2 id="3d-virtual-fitting-technology">3D virtual fitting technology</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another way to utilize 3D technology in the fashion industry is by taking advantage of 3D virtual fitting technology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a rising number of returns and landfill waste, fashion desperately needs technologies that will help to address the issue of poor fit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many fashion companies, like Macy's and ASOS, and luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior, are already exploring the potential of AR clothing try-on technology in the fashion retail space. Their virtual fitting solutions allow consumers to preview garments on their own bodies, whether they're at home or in-store.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"linkDestination":"custom"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/D6syzHwQVQx93KNZWwKZ4ubFeVjiKKFUhatKBMYI_twwOda8Sr8V8_LH2Q6ESJZLRAonWVElENlsAK-Z7YCZsr3lbJLPlxxQ4_Ob78Fn4Blzvcd8PTrYGKgrkLps3EkvErqGSVjzK14jSCde-K9peZ5GK-5hFpmhAccRKRCZyWDsIWyBZvjPpswy6Q" alt="3D virtual fitting technology"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Image source&nbsp;<a href="https://mysurefit.com/fitting-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mysurefit</em></a></em></figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Virtual fitting rooms allow consumers to try on the garments without physically wearing them. To implement 3D virtual fitting technology, fashion brands use their customers' body data. The AR technology maps a virtual version of a product to the customerâs body on top of a realistic 3D avatar using a camera-equipped device.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are certain challenges that fashion brands may face while utilizing virtual fitting solutions. First of all, the implementation costs. The other challenge is data privacy concerns among consumers. Mobile body scanning, visual fitting rooms, and virtual try-on technology all face the additional challenge of storing consumer data such as names, addresses, banking information, and biometric data. To allay consumer fears, solutions must be designed with privacy in mind, and companies must provide transparency and security when storing customer data.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beyond these challenges, 3D virtual fitting technology has enormous potential to improve the way fashion is designed, sold, and consumed. By reducing the number of physical samples that end up in landfills or creating a virtual fitting room for e-commerce that can reduce return rates.</p>
